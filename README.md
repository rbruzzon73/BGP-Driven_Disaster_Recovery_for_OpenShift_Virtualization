# BGP-Driven Disaster Recovery for OpenShift Virtualization
<br>

## MetalLB Layer 3 (BGP) as a foundational component for Disaster Recovery strategies in OpenShift Virtualization

- The BGP-driven Disaster Recovery architecture utilizes MetalLB in Layer 3 (BGP) mode as a foundational component.
This approach leverages the reconvergence capabilities of the network infrastructure Control Plane, where the BGP protocol of the MetalLB in Layer 3 is enabled (Figure 1).

- MetalLB in Layer 3 mode (BGP mode) within an OpenShift Virtualization Cluster enables the allocation of External IP addresses for OpenShift Load Balancer services connected to virtual machines (service's  endpoints).

- MetalLB advertises external IP addresses as Network Layer Reachability Information (NLRI composed by Network Prefix and Network Length) to the network's control plane via BGP.
This feature facilitates the deployment of scalable, highly available network services, including those based on dual-stack (IPv4 and IPv6)."

- The implementation of a Disaster Recovery architecture based on MetalLB in Layer 3 mode (BGP mode) offers a cost-effective alternative to traditional hardware load balancing solutions.
This approach leads to a significant reduction in the total cost of ownership of the infrastructure due to the following advantages:

   - The external load balancer (LB) is no longer necessary in the Disaster Recovery setup based on the BGP-driven architecture (Figure 1).
     This is because load balancing functionality is now managed by the OpenShift Load Balancer Services with external IP addresses, which are directly advertised through the BGP protocol of the MetalLB in Layer 3 mode.

   - The DNS Global Load Balancer (DNS GLB) is no longer necessary for Disaster Recovery based on the BGP-driven architecture (Figure 1).
     In this scenario,  the reachability of External IP addresses associated with the OpenShift Load Balancer Service is maintained through the reconvergence capabilities of the Network Control Plane. 

- The adoption of a Network Topology where the External IP Addresses assigned to the LoadBalancer Services and learned from the External BGP routers are redistributed, towards an Interior Gateway Protocol (OSPF in Figure 1), eliminates the complexities associated with the full mesh requirement of the iBGP protocol.

   Note: <br>
   DNS GLB will remain relevant in Business Continuity architectures that require an RTO (Total Downtime) of zero.
   In such cases, different sets of IP Address Pools  are assigned to the MetalLB of the OpenShift Virtualization Clusters to grant the scenarios where the VMs operate in an active-active mode (Figure 2).

- The MetalLB architecture in Layer 3 (BGP mode) relies on the FRR (FRRouting) suite to instantiate the BGP Speaker PODs in the designated nodes within Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization.

- The objective of the MetalLB BGP Speakers is to advertise, to the external iBGP or eBGP peers (iBGP in this Proof Of Concept), the Network Layer Reachability Information (NLRI) related to the External IP addresses assigned to the LoadBalancer services.

- The BGP Equal-Cost Multi-Path (ECMP) feature (Figure 3), which allows for the distribution of traffic across multiple equal-cost paths to the same destination, along with BGP's failover capabilities, are critical components that enhance both the scalability and performance of a BGP-based disaster recovery solution.\
Additionally, the reconvergence capabilities of routing protocols contribute significantly to the system resilience.

- Bidirectional Forward Detection (BFD) plays a vital role in BGP performance by reducing the time required to detect network failures.
BFD can identify failures within milliseconds, offering a substantial improvement over the standard keepalive timeout recommendations of 20 seconds specified in RFC 4271, with some third-party providers adopting longer timeouts such as 60 seconds.

- The default configuration of the MetalLB BGP Speaker is to deny any Network Layer Reachability Information (NLRI) advertised by the BGP peers (external routers).
This posture presents a technical challenge regarding how to enable connectivity from internal endpoints behind the LoadBalancer services to remote subnets that are not directly connected to the Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization worker nodes.

- The Network Address Translation (NAT) process implemented on the external router connected to the worker nodes of OpenShift Virtualization is one of the possible approaches for managing this type of network complexity (Figure 4) connected to the traditional Kubernetes networking where the MetalLB architecture in Layer 3 (BGP mode) speaker are involved.
An alternative approach for managing this complexity is available in this Red Hat blog post: [Learning Kubernetes nodes networking routes via BGP](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/learning-kubernetes-nodes-networking-routes-via-bgp).

- Implementing user-defined networks (UDNs) in Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization using Virtual Routing and Forwarding (VRF), advertising them via BGP with FRRouting speakers, and injecting learned BGP prefixes back into the VRF creates an adaptable solution that makes entire user-defined networks (UDNs) prefixes, not just LoadBalancer service IPs, directly reachable from the customers network infrastructure This topic, related to user-defined networks (UDNs) exposed via BGP routing protocol, is extensively discussed in this article: [Exposing OpenShift networks using BGP](https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2025/10/23/exposing-openshift-networks-using-bgp#the_benefits_of_bgp_for_openshift_networking)

## Administration of the MetalLB IPAddressPools and External IP Address advertisement via BGP.

- MetalLB can automatically allocate External IP addresses (IPv4 and IPv6), to OpenShift Virtualization services of type LoadBalancer, from any IP address pool where autoAssign is set to true (Figure 5).

- MetalLB offers manual IP address assignment to enhance administrators' control over the allocation of external IP addresses for LoadBalancer services.
Manual allocation of External IP Addresses (Figure 5) can be implemented by means of these configurations :

   |                                                        |                                                                                                                                                                              |
   | :---------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | **Setting required for manual External IP allocation** |                                                                                **Description**                                                                               |
   |                   autoAssigne: false                   | Field to be added to the IPAddressPool’s spec planned for manual External IP allocation. The target of this field is preventing any automatic IP assignment from this pool.. |
   |     metallb.io/address-pool: \<IPAddressPool name>     |   Annotation to be added to the OpenShift Virtualization Service and valorized with the name of the IPAddressPool planned as source for the manual External IP Allocation.   |
   |  LoadBalancerIP: \<IP address to be assigned manually> |                  Field to be added to the  OpenShift Virtualization Service and valorized with the IP Address to be manually assigned to the service itself.                 |

- The selection of the IP Address Pool (the source from which the External IP address will be assigned) can be influenced by other factors, as illustrated in this table:

   |                              |                                                                                                                        |

   |       serviceSelectors       |      ServiceSelectors list of label selector to select service(s) for which ip poolcan be used for ip allocation.      |

- The IPAddressPools must be included within the BGPAdvertisement object to enable the advertisement of Network Layer Reachability Information (NLRI), which consists of the Network Prefix and Prefix Length associated with external IP addresses assigned to LoadBalancer services.

- The purpose of the BGPAdvertisement (Figure 6) is to establish a relationship between the IPAddressPools (specifically which External IP Addresses assigned will be advertised from each IPAddressPools) and the BGP peers (to which the External IP Addresses will be advertised) involved in the BGP sessions with the MetalLB speakers.

- This configuration ensures that the External IP Addresses advertised as Network Layer Reachability Information to the BGP peers will be accessible from outside the OpenShift Virtualization cluster.

- It is important to note that the Network Layer Reachability Information, connected to the External IP Addresses assigned to the LoadBalancer service, will only be advertised if at least one virtual machine is active and connected as an endpoint to the LoadBalancer service.

- NLRI advertisement can be influenced by these BGAdvertisements fields:

   |                            |                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

   |      aggregationLength     |                               The aggregation-length advertisement option lets you “roll up” the /32s into a larger prefix. Defaults to 32. Works for IPv4 addresses.                               |
   |     aggregationLengthV6    |                              The aggregation-length advertisement option lets you “roll up” the /128s into a larger prefix. Defaults to 128. Works for IPv6 addresses.                              |
   |   ipAddressPoolSelectors   | A selector for the IPAddressPools which would get advertised via this advertisement.If no IPAddressPool is selected by this or by the list, the advertisement is applied to all the IPAddressPools. |
   |       ipAddressPools       |                                                          The list of IPAddressPools to advertise via this advertisement, selected by name.                                                          |
   |       nodeSelectors        |                       NodeSelectors allows to limit the nodes to announce as next hops for the LoadBalancer IP. When empty, all the nodes having  are announced as next hops.                       |
   |           peers            |                         Peers limits the BGP peer to advertise the ips of the selected pools to.When empty, the loadbalancer IP is announced to all the BGPPeers configured.                        |

- In a BGP-driven network topology based on iBGP, where the local ASN matches the peer ASN (Figure 1), the behavior of the BGP protocol can be affected by both the BGP Peer configurations and the BFD Profile, as perceptible in the next two tables.\

- Please note that the BGPPeer Custom Resource (CR) contains the necessary information to establish a BGP session with a single peer.\
To establish sessions with multiple external routers, it is necessary to define multiple BGPPeer CRs, as illustrated in Figure 6.

### Disaster Recovery prerequisite:

- The availability of the latest full backup, or point-in-time (PIT) backups if applicable, of the virtual machine resources associated with rhel8-server stored externally from the primary OpenShift Virtualization cluster, along with the ability to restore these resources in the disaster recovery (DR) OpenShift Virtualization environment, is a prerequisite for this demonstration, as illustrated in Figure 8. 

- In this context, OpenShift-ADP was utilized to create a full backup of the rhel8-server virtual machine from the primary OpenShift Virtualization cluster and to restore it within the DR OpenShift Virtualization environment during the recovery process described below.

### Primary cluster isolation:

- After isolating the Primary OpenShift Virtualization environment (which involved disabling the external router interface, as indicated in Figure 9), the VM client experiences a loss of connectivity towards the external IP address of the virtual machine rhel8-server.

  ~~~
  [admin@vm-server ~]$ tracepath -m8 192.11.1.100

- The external IP address of the virtual machine rhel8-server will be accessible again once the restoration procedures are completed and the OSPF and BGP protocols have reconverged to direct traffic to the DR OpenShift Virtualization cluster.

### Restore process on DR cluster

- Following the completion of the restore process on the DR OpenShift Virtualization cluster, the virtual machine rhel8-server has been successfully restored and reassigned to the same external IP address previously utilized in the primary cluster:
